# Project Movies

The purpose of the assignment was to learn more about React Router, and how to create multiple-paged applications. 

## The problem

I had a more thorough approach compared to previous weeks, where I tried to dissect the problem and document learnings in a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/detNiusExcQ3mV2egU9PH7/W12-%E2%80%93-Movie-page). This was a great help in order for me to understand the scope of the problem and find resources to help me move forward with the basic requirements.

After the basic requirements I tried to go into unknown territory and basically tried to implement some more features (next/previous page) just trying to piece things together using my (limited) knowledge and some form of logic. Didn't work out *great* – upon loading the page, you have to click "next" two times in order for it to start working. But hey, we're all new to this – so I'm happy enough.

Two more things I didn't manage to figure out:

* The backdrop image in the movieDetails.js page says "undefined" in the console, but works when browsing. What's up with that?
* Couldn't figure out how to loop through the array of genres. Code is commented out for now, but I might get back to it when I'm not as tired.
